## My process
I layed out all the html elements first, whilst giving them all classes for styling purposes.Referring to the figma
files provided a good visual reference when it came to styling with css.


### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

I initially styled all elements using px first and then went back and replaced these with rem's. This helped me
I think get the structure first. I learned the very basics of Figma.


### Continued development

To get a better understanding of figma and its capabilities, so as to make the development process easier. I need to create my own structured system for development i.e. a checklist of tasks

### Useful resources

- [MDN reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is always handy to have open on my desktop.
